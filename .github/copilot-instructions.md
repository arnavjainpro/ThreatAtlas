# ThreatAtlas - Vulnerability Assessment Dashboard

This is a React and Vite project for a security vulnerability assessment dashboard. The application displays three types of vulnerability scores:

1. **Base Vulnerable Score** - Core vulnerability assessment
2. **Actionable Score** - Actionable items that can be remediated
3. **Total Score** - Combined score of base vulnerability and actionable items

## Project Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Implement responsive design for dashboard components
- Use modern CSS or CSS-in-JS for styling
- Focus on security-themed UI/UX design
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Use proper error handling and loading states
- Implement clean, modular component architecture
